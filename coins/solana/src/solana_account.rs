/// The basis for all Solana wallets, wrapping a Keypair from the Solana SDK.
///
/// In Solana, everything is an account. For naming consistency, we call this a `SolanaAccount`.
/// ### Key Concepts:
/// - Accounts store data and have a unique address (usually a public key).
/// - Accounts have a max size of 10MB; Program-Derived Accounts (PDAs) are limited to 10KB.
/// - PDAs can sign on behalf of a program.
/// - Account sizes are fixed at creation but can be adjusted using `realloc`.
/// - Data storage is paid with rent.
/// - Default account owner is the System Program.
/// - Generate an account in the CLI using `solana-keygen new`.
///
/// ### Account Fields:
/// - **lamports**: Number of lamports owned by the account.
/// - **owner**: Program owner of the account.
/// - **executable**: Whether the account can process instructions.
/// - **data**: Raw data byte array stored by the account.
/// - **rent_epoch**: Next epoch when rent is owed.
///
/// Only the account's owner can modify its data or debit lamports. Anyone can credit lamports.
/// The owner can reassign ownership if the account's data is zeroed out.
/// Program accounts do not store state.
///
/// Example: A counter program requires two accountsâ€”one for the program code and one for the counter.
