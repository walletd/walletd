# WalletD HD Key

`walletd_hd_key` is a Rust library implementation of the BIP-32 standard's hierarchical deterministic (HD) key generation. 

More information about this crate can be found in the [crate documentation][docs].

## High level features

This library supports key generation using the following BIPs (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal).

- [BIP32][bip32] - Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets
- [BIP44][bip44] - Multi-Account Hierarchy for Deterministic Wallets
- [BIP49][bip49] - Derivation scheme for P2WPKH-nested-in-P2SH based accounts
- [BIP84][bip84] - Derivation scheme for P2WPKH based accounts

## Usage example

See the [crate documentation][docs] usage examples.

## Safety

This crate uses `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` to ensure everything is implemented in
100% safe Rust.

## Minimum supported Rust version

hd_key's MSRV is 1.60.
